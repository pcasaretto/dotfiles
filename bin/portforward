# Multiple port forward made easy.
#
# This script helps with port forwarding multiple ports using simple commands
# It is specially useful when combined with shell expansion (http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html)
#
# USAGE:
#
#   $ portforward host 3000
#   # => opens a ssh connection with -N and -T with host and forward local port 3000 to localhost:3000 @ host
#
#   $ portforward host 3000 3001
#   $ portforward host {3000..3010}
#   # => forwards ports 3000 up to 3010
